## 👩 About me

I am Nasikhat Dadaeva specialist in linguistics and computer science.
I have always been interested in combining language and modern technology. With the advent of computational linguistics specialists, this became possible.
Linguistics and IT are overlapping areas. Both fields (Linguistics and IT) deal with syntax, semantics and instructions - and how people perceive them.

I enjoy contributing to new projects and learning new computer technologies. I have already learnt MS SQL and am now developing several projects using it.


## 📌 My projects
- [WeatherDatabase](http://209.38.230.157:5000/) - Interactive map of Russian weather stations and weather statistics based on data from VNIIGMI-MDC (the site includes a frontend based on JavaScript and a backend based on Flask)
