## ðŸ‘© About me

I am Nasikhat Dadaeva, a specialist in the field of linguistics and computer science. 

I have always been interested in combining language and modern technology. The emergence of new LLM models like ChatGPT opened up new horizons for learning for me. The emergence of new LLM models like ChatGPT opened up new horizons for me to study and revealed to me that linguistics and information technology are highly overlapping fields. Both areas deal with syntax, semantics, and instructions, and how people perceive them.

I enjoy contributing to new projects and learning new computer technologies. I have already learnt MS SQL and am now developing several projects using it.


## ðŸ“Œ My projects
- [WeatherDatabase](http://209.38.230.157:5000/) - Interactive map of Russian weather stations and weather statistics based on data from VNIIGMI-MDC (the site includes a frontend based on JavaScript and a backend based on Flask)
- [#Table_to_@Table_variable_Script](https://github.com/Nasikhat/Nasikhat/blob/main/%23table_to_%40table_variable.sql) - The script allows you to quickly and easily replace the temporary tables used in the code with table variables, without having to specify the names and data types of the columns.)
